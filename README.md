## Drive board for cb11

This repository contains the files for our Drive Board db11. 

It is designed to be used with our controller board cb11 (see [NTB Wiki](http://wiki.ntb.ch/infoportal/embedded_systems/imx6/cb)).
It can be used together with [cb20](https://github.com/ntb-ch/cb20), but you have to consider the different headers and pin mapping.
